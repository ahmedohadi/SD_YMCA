          THE MINUTE YOU CONFUSE A TOY WITH A FLOTATION DEVICE
      </h3>
      <h6>
          Thereâ€™s a difference between a Coast Guard-approved flotation device and an inflatable pool toy. One looks adorable on a three-year-old, but is worthless in protecting your child from drowning. Take a minute and supply your pool with approved PFDs and life vests.

          THE ONE MINUTE TEXT MESSAGE
      </h3>
      <h6>
          The time it takes to read a text message or answer a phone call is all it takes for a child to drown. Never assume that because several adults are by the pool, someone is watching the kids. Play it safe. Assign one adult, a Water Watcher, to supervise pool activities at all times

        THE MINUTE SOMEONE IS A HERO
    </h3>
    <h6>
        The only thing scarier than a child beginning to drown is the person who tries to be a hero. The instinct to dive in and rescue is one you need to overcome. Typically, the panicking child will cause the one attempting a rescue to drown with them. If you see someone struggling in the water, stay on land and toss him or her a flotation device, extend to them a rope or hold out a pole.

          THE MINUTE YOU LEAVE THE GATE OPEN
        </h3>
        <h6>
            When not in use, pools should be fenced and gates should be kept locked. Recent studies indicate that having a four-sided fence around a pool can reduce drownings by up to 80%. But a fence is of little value if the gate is left unlocked.

            THE ONE MINUTE SUN BATH

          <h6>
              When children are at the pool your undivided attention needs to be on watching them. Not working on your tan, squirting sunscreen or taking a one-minute siesta. Even if your children have had swimming lessons, you need to supervise them closely.
