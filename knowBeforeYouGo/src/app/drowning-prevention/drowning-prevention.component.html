    <li>Drowning is the leading cause of death for children ages 1-4 and the second leading cause of accidental death for children under 14 years of age.</li>
        <li>Children under one years of age most often drown in a bathtub, toilet, or bucket.</li>
        <li>Most drowning events happen in water not at the child’s home – at swim parties, or a family’s or neighbor’s house.</li>
        <li>94% of parents supervise their children while swimming, however many admit they are engaged in other distracting activities during that time.</li>
        <li>Children’s Health treats approximately 100 children for drowning/near-drowning incidents each year. Approximately 3,500 children are treated in emergency rooms for near drowning incidents each year.</li>
        <li>More than 900 children lose their lives drowning each year in the United States. For every child who dies by drowning, another four are hospitalized. Many never recover from brain damage that occurs while they are under water.</li>
        <li>Drowning is a silent event. Children will rarely scream, call out or splash for help.</li>
        <li>Submersion takes less than 10 seconds. Losing consciousness takes 2 minutes. Permanent brain damage takes only 4-6 minutes.</li>
